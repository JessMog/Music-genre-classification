genre detection
## Introduction
Music genre classification is the process  where a piece of music is recognized, understood and differentiated by a conventional category as belonging to a shared traditions set of conventions.

In this project we are interested in working on genre detection as a probabilistic distribution of various genres as they pertain to the underlying styles of songs,albums and artists.We will be using a neural network model for this.We shall be tagging 10 genres and fine tune our model to achieve higher accuracy.
The dataset used for this project is GTZAN Music Genre Classification from kaggle.
### The Team
Jesse and Hazra Kerubo will work jointly on building a neural network model for this project.
## Overview
We are going to develop a deep learning project to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. We will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.


For this project we need a dataset of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range.

## The Data Source(s)
We will be using the GTZAN genre classification dataset from kaggle for the music genre classification project and it was collected for this task only.
The GTZAN genre collection dataset was collected in 2000-2001. It consists of 1000 audio files each having 30 seconds duration. There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format. It contains audio files of the following 10 genres:
Blues
Classical
Country
Disco
Hiphop
Jazz
Metal
Pop
Reggae
Rock
